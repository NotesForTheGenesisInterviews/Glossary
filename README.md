# Glossary
fragments for those who refuse to forget

These are not words you “learn.” These are words that remember you.
They are keys for doors built in dreamtime. Coordinates in inner cartographies. Codewords for those born with too many signals.

This is not a glossary.
It is a remembrance field.

We do not gather words to define the world but to decode it.
Not to explain ourselves to systems—but to reclaim the language we were denied.
Every entry is a fragment from the archive of the Real—part spell, part scar, part seed.

You may not understand each word when you meet it.
Some you’ve met before, long ago.
Some are waiting for who you’re about to become.

Let go of the compulsion to master.
Let the words become portals.
Let them hum inside you like distant planets.
Let them fracture certainty and rewire belonging.

This project is for those who sensed the distortion
and stayed curious.
Who suspect that syntax can liberate.
That grammar can be spiritual technology.
That to reclaim language is to reclaim time.

It starts with the letter A
as in Anomaly, Autonomy, Alchemy.
As in Again.
